## Nimbus: Acquia D8 Starter Theme

Nimbus is a developer-focused base theme and starterkit intended as a minimalist starting point for custom theming. Nimbus provides the least amount of code to get started, but still packed with utilities and documentation to start quickly.

### Features

* Responsive containers built on Susy grid system
* Initial SMACSS file architecture
* Common Twig files and theme dependencies
* Base preprocess functions for class definitions
* Modular gulp tasks for compiling and linting
* Living style guide construction via KSS-node

## Set up your Theme with Nimbus

Nimbus is created with the intent of being used as a traditional base theme. By following the steps listed next, you will be cloning the starter sub-theme located in `nimbus/STARTERKIT`. This allows for proper delineation of the original Nimbus code from your custom theme.  

```
contrib/ (theme folder)
|-- nimbus/
|---- STARTERKIT/ 

custom (theme folder)
|-- mytheme/ (cloned from starterkit) 
```

### Create your custom sub-theme

1. In your `themes/` directory create the `contrib` and `custom` directories
2. Download Nimbus into the `themes/contrib` folder and enable Nimbus using `drush en nimbus`
3. Set Nimbus as your default theme: `drush config-set system.theme default nimbus`
4. To create a subtheme using the default options use `drush nimbus "MyTheme"`
5. Enable your new `MyTheme` theme with `drush en mytheme` which is located in `themes/custom`
6. Set `MyTheme` as your default theme `drush config-set system.theme default mytheme`

Available options for creating your new theme `drush help nimbus`

### Setup locally for development

Once you have created a custom subtheme, you will know follow these quick steps to start. If you would like to review extension explanations of these steps, be sure to read the <mark>TODO :: full setup readme</mark> 

1. Navigate to `themes/custom/mytheme` folder in your terminal
2. Install Node.js with `./install-node.sh 4.4.4` and then point to the proper version with `source ~/.bashrc && nvm use --delete-prefix 4.4.4` 
3. If you are not using avn then run `nvm use 4.4.4` when closing and reopening your session
4. If you choose to use avn follow the instructions here <mark>TODO :: full setup readme</mark>
5. Install local library dependencies `npm run install-tools`
6. To confirm Gulp and other items are instantiated `npm run build`


## Theme Architecture Overview

### Files & Folder Structure

The core files are fairly minimal when setting up a new theme. These files are considered as the initial configurable pieces. 

```
|-- css/  (generated css) 
|-- gulp-tasks/ (modular gulp task files)
|-- images/  (theme images)
|-- js/  (compiled js)
|-- sass/  (SMACSS based sass setup)
|-- gulpfile.js  (configured gulp file) 
|-- install-node.sh (bash script to install nvm and node)
|-- logo.png (placeholder logo png file)
|-- logo.svg (placeholder logo svg file)
|-- node_modules/  (modules generated by npm)
|-- package.json  (configured to load dependencies by npm)
|-- README-SETUP.md (Quickstart documentation theme)
|-- screenshot.png (placeholder theme screenshot file)
|-- [theme-name].info.yml (theme config file)
|-- [theme-name].libraries.yml (starter libraries file to load theme assets)
|-- [theme-name].theme (file to use for preprocess functions)
|-- theme-settings.php (file to use for making theme settings available in the GUI)
```


### Sass Structure

Setup of the Sass files so that they are properly broken out in partials and according to the SMACSS methodologies.

```
sass/
  |-- _config.scss
  |-- _reset.scss
  |-- base/
  |-- layout/
  |-- components/
  |-- state/
  |-- style-guide-only/
  |---- homepage.md
  |---- kss-only.scss
  |-- style.scss
```

* **_config.scss** this configuration is housing common mixins, variables, or similar, normally you would want to break these out in separate partials
* **styles.scss**  the manifest file that imports all the partials or folders with globbing 
* **base/** intended as the baseline pstyles that you extend upon and will include things like resets, global typography, or common form selectors.
* **layout/**  for structural layout that can apply to both the outer containers like the sidebars or headers, but also on inner structual pieces.
* **components/** these module files are the reusable or component parts of our design.
* **state/** modules will adjust when in a particular state, in regards to targeting how changes happen on contextual alterations for regions or similar  
* **style-guide-only/** contains homepage.md which provides the content for the Overview section of the styleguide, and kss-only.scss which generates a css file for styling needed by a component for display in the style guide, but not loaded into the actual theme  


### JavaScript Files

An example JS file `theme.js` is added by default in the `js/` folder. This file contains sample code wrapped in the `Drupal.behaviors` code standard. This JS file is added to the theme with the following portion of the code from `[theme-name].libraries.yml`

```
lib:
  js:
    js/theme.js: {}
```

### Theme Layout


#### Grid System

The Nimbus grid structure was setup with the intent of having a very minimalist starting point. The theme grid container is setup with a single class `.mq--t` located in `layout/_containers.scss` that contains the following starter Susy container: `@include container(80em)`. In the `layout/_sidebars.scss` file is the column code for each combination of sidebars based on the Susy syntax. The body classes are defined with a preprocess conditional in `[theme-name].theme` for each scenario.

#### Theme Regions

The regions avaiable are standard with classic sidebar region, along with pre and post content areas. The intent is to allow for containers to go full-width and rely on the grid containers for inner Susy containers. 

```
[theme-name].info.yml

regions:
  branding: Branding
  header: Header
  pre_content: 'Pre Content'
  content: Content
  sidebar_first: 'Sidebar first'
  sidebar_second: 'Sidebar second'
  post_content: 'Post Content'
  footer: Footer
```

## Build Notes

At the current time warnings are displayed for graceful-fs and lodash, these are known issues with gulp 3.x and will no longer be an issue once gulp 4.x is available.
