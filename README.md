## Nimbus: Acquia D8 Starter Theme

Nimbus is a developer-focused base theme and starterkit intended as a minimalist starting point for custom theming. Nimbus provides the least amount of code to get started, but still packed with utilities and documentation to start quickly.

Nimbus includes baseline integrations with: 

* Core *.yml and theme dependencies
* SMACSS css architecture
* Modular gulpfile for front end builds
* Living style guide construction via KSS-node

## Set up your Theme with Nimbus

### Create your Starter Theme

1. In your `themes/` directory create the `contrib` and `custom` directories
2. Download Nimbus into the `themes/contrib` folder and enable Nimbus using `drush en nimbus`
3. Set Nimbus as your default theme: `drush config-set system.theme default nimbus`
4. To create a subtheme using the default options use `drush nimbus "MyTheme"`
5. Enable your new `MyTheme` theme with `drush en mytheme` which is located in `themes/custom`
6. Set `MyTheme` as your default theme `drush config-set system.theme default mytheme`

Available options for creating your new theme `drush help nimbus`

### Setting locally for development

Once you have created a custom subtheme, you will know follow these quick steps to start. If you would like to review extension explanations of these steps, be sure to read the XXXXXXX

2. Install Node.js with `./install-node.sh 4.4.4` and then point to the proper version with `source ~/.bashrc && nvm use --delete-prefix 4.4.4` 
3. If you are not using avn then run `nvm use 4.4.4` when closing and reopening your session
4. If you choose to use avn follow the instructions here XXXXX
5. Install local library dependencies `npm run install-tools`
6. To confirm Gulp and other items are instantiated `npm run build`


## Theme Architecture Overview

### Files & Folder Structure

The core files are fairly minimal when setting up a new theme. These files are considered as the initial configurable pieces. 

```
|-- css/  (generated css) 
|-- gulp-tasks/ (modular gulp task files)
|-- images/  (theme images)
|-- js/  (compiled js)
|-- sass/  (SMACSS based sass setup)
|-- gulpfile.js  (configured gulp file) 
|-- install-node.sh (bash script to install nvm and node)
|-- logo.png (placeholder theme logo file)
|-- logo.svg (placeholder theme logo file)
|-- node_modules/  (modules generated by npm)
|-- package.json  (configured to load dependencies by npm)
|-- README-SETUP.md (Quickstart documentation theme)
|-- screenshot.png (placeholder theme screenshot file)
|-- [theme-name].info.yml (theme config file)
|-- [theme-name].libraries.yml (starter libraries file to load theme assets)
|-- [theme-name].theme (file to use for preprocess functions)
|-- theme-settings.php (file to use for making theme settings available in the GUI)

```

### Sass Structure

Setup of the Sass files so that they are properly broken out in partials and according to the [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) methodologies.

```
sass/
  |-- _config.scss
  |-- _reset.scss
  |-- base/
  |-- layout/
  |-- components/
  |-- state/
  |-- style-guide-only/
  |---- homepage.md
  |---- kss-only.scss
  |-- style.scss
```

* **_config.scss** this configuration is housing common mixins, variables, or similar, normally you would want to break these out in separate partials
* **styles.scss**  the manifest file that imports all the partials or folders with globbing 
* **base/** intended as the baseline pstyles that you extend upon and will include things like resets, global typography, or common form selectors.
* **layout/**  for structural layout that can apply to both the outer containers like the sidebars or headers, but also on inner structual pieces.
* **components/** these module files are the reusable or component parts of our design.
* **state/** modules will adjust when in a particular state, in regards to targeting how changes happen on contextual alterations for regions or similar  
* **style-guide-only/** contains homepage.md which provides the content for the Overview section of the styleguide, and kss-only.scss which generates a css file for styling needed by a component for display in the style guide, but not loaded into the actual theme  



### JavaScript Files

An example JS file is provided, it is likely that multiple JS files will be greated and loaded in appropriate situations via library files.

```
js/
  |-- example.js
```

**example.js** :: this files is intended to illustrate the Drupal.behaviors() placeholder for future development
